# About

Hello there! My name is Hannah Skye Smith. I am soon to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Urban Ecology from the College of Architecture and Planning at the University of Utah. 

I am ecstatic to launch my career in urban planning and design. [Click here](assets/files/cv.pdf) for a print version of my resume, and [here](worksample) for work samples.

I'm currently located in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah and looking for a position on the east coast. I'd love to discuss any opportunities and connect!
