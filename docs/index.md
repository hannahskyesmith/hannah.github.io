# About

Hello there! My name is Hannah Skye Smith. I am soon to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Urban Ecology from the College of Architecture and Planning at the University of Utah. I'm saying goodbye beautiful Salt Lake City and heading to Boston, MA by the end of the summer. 

I am ecstatic to launch my career in urban planning and design. Please [click here](assets/files/cv.pdf) for a print version of my resume, and [here](work_sample) to view work samples.

 I'd love to discuss any opportunities and connect!
